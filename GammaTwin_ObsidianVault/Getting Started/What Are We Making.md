### Quick Pitch
Gamma Trip is a narrative driven, drop in multiplayer twin stick shmup (shoot-em-up) that is intended to be the spiritual successor to [Galaga Legions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bs7taVEPkk&list=PLLidP1V2gouzeRLNQ1pu25B9-8ZAiTM8y)

### Gameplay Pillars
We're pulling a lot from Galaga Legions DX for now, those pillars are:
1. Enemy Hell not Bullet Hell. Large swaths of enemies are the primary threat.
2. Scripted waves of enemy patterns. Each wave will tell the player an intended path of where enemies will be coming from, but not what will be coming.
3. 1 primary ship, 2 satellite ships. (TBD: Satellites can be placed and recalled vs Satellites stick to ship and aim in direction of Right Stick)
4. Hit Stop on bomb hit/boss kill/near death: These things make the game feel more engaging
5. **FOR NOW:** Time based high score chaser. Having a main timer that counts down to encourage players to chase smarter forms of play. 
Our New Pillars:
6. Drop in/out mid-session multiplayer. Player's should be able to help out in the middle of a session. How this impacts difficulty and "Where they are allowed  to drop in" is TBD.
7. Character narrative driven mechanics. Each part of a squad (1 ship, 2 satellites) can be equipped with different mechanical play styles to encourage different loadouts. Improving relationships with these characters may have benefits too. Taking notes from [13 Sentinels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_Sentinels:_Aegis_Rim)
8. Mode specific play: Extending past just typical shmup gameplay of "completing a stage and beating the boss". Taking notes from [Geometry Wars 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/310790/Geometry_Wars_3_Dimensions_Evolved/). These could be anything from specific objectives, survive a timer, arena based combat, etc. TBD
9. Roguelite progression: To leave a planet you must leave it's orbit, to leave it's orbit you must complete a slingshot maneuver around the planet. This means players will plot their path through a planets orbit and each node will have an objective and a reward.
